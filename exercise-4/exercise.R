# Exercise 4: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read data into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv` function
# Make sure *not* to read the strings as factors
# setwd("~/Desktop/ch9-dataframes/exercise-4/")
grants <- read.csv('gates_money.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Use the View function to look at your data
# View(grants)

# Create a variable `spending` as the `total_amount` column of the dataset
spending <- grants$total_amount

# Confirm that your `spending` variable is a vector using the `is.vector` function
# is.vector(spending)
# [1] TRUE

# Create a variable `org` as the `organization` column of the dataset.
org <- grants$organization

### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?
# mean(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
# max(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
# min(grants$total_amount)

# Which organization received the largest grant?
# grants$organization[grants$total_amount == max(grants$total_amount)]

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
# grants$organization[grants$total_amount == min(grants$total_amount)]

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
awarded <- grants$organization[grants$start_year == 2010]
num.of.awarded.in.2010 <- length(awarded)
